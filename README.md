# Pizza Sales Analysis Project

This project provides a detailed analysis of pizza sales data using *SQL* for data extraction and *Microsoft Excel* for data visualization. It uncovers key business insights to help improve decision-making in a pizza restaurant's operations and strategy.

## üìä Project Summary

- *Objective*: Analyze sales data to identify performance trends, customer behavior, and product insights.
- *Tools Used*:
  - SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
  - Microsoft Excel (PivotTables, Charts, Slicers, Dashboards)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Total revenue, total orders, and average order value
- Best and worst selling pizzas
- Sales breakdown by pizza size and category
- Busiest days and hours for sales
- Monthly and hourly trends
- Interactive Excel dashboard for visualization

## üß† Insights

- Friday and Saturday evenings are peak sales periods
- Larger pizzas generate more revenue
- "The classic Chicken Pizza" are top-performing items
- Some pizzas have consistently poor sales and may need review
- Visual analysis highlights seasonal and hourly patterns

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. *SQL Queries*:
   - Used to clean, join, and analyze raw order and menu data.
   - Extracted key metrics like order totals, item frequencies, and revenue.

2. *Excel Dashboard*:
   - Built using PivotTables and charts.
   - Includes slicers for filtering by date, category, size, and more.
